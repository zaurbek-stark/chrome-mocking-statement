# MockingThisText - Chrome Extension

This is the codebase for the Chrome extension that I built in this video. It turns the selected text into its mOcKeD vErSiOn and copies it in the clipboard.

## How to test it

1. Go to the Chrome extensions page. You can either do it by entering `chrome://extensions` in the url bar, or by opening the Chrome menu > "More tools" > "Extensions.
2. Toggle "Developper Mode" in the top right
3. Click on the "Load extension" button in the top left
4. Select the extension you want to load
5. Select any text on any webpage, right click, and select "Copy as Mocked Text"
6. When you paste that text, you will see it in its mOcKeD vErSiOn.
